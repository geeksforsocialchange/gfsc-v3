# Shortcodes

## `image-with-caption/start` & `image-with-caption/end` 

### Example

```
{{<image-with-caption/start "ask-jeeves.png" "Screenshot of Ask Jeeves" "frame image--center">}}
Fig 1. The branding of Ask Jeeves (Ask.com) in the early days of the internet exemplified this view of computers as personal assistants. 
{{<image-with-caption/end>}}
```

### Arguments

1. URL for the image
2. Alt text for the image
3. Classes to be added to the image. It looks to originally have taken a single word which was appended to `image--`. It has been craftily used in many places with two classes by writing the full class name for the second half of the argument and separating with a space. See `themes/gfsc/assets/sass/components/_images.sass`.
4. Caption body accepts normal markdown as in the rest of the file. It is important to place this between the `start` and `end` shortcodes.

## `image-multi-with-caption/start` & `image-multi-with-caption/end` 

### Example

```
{{<image-multi-with-caption/start "scarecat.jpg gianthand.jpg" "Some items listed barely pass as innovations. Scare Cat (left) and Giant Hands (right)." "frame">}}
Some items listed barely pass as innovations. Scare Cat (left) and Giant Hands (right).[^1]
