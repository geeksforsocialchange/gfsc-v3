# Project Images

## Project list images

The preview image in list view is set in the front matter of the project and will need to be located in the page bundle.

imagealt: police in a line wearing riot gear
```

## Project gallery

Any jpg file located in the project folder will appear automatically in a gallery. There is currently not a way to specify order aside from the file names. There is currently not a way to add alt text.
