We welcome donations from anyone who is interested in our work and would like to help us continue it. Your donations will directly support overlooked and under-funded communities across the UK and around the world.

We are known for our trans-positive, anti-racist, community-led projects, and seek backers who share our politics and mindset, and want to be part of what we’re striving to build — a better world, with better tech.
