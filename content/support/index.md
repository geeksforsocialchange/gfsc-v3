## How we fund our work

GFSC studio works with paying clients and on grant-funded projects. As a collective we also strive to take on worthy projects that don't necessarily come with a source of funding, often those bought to our attention by members of the collective.

The money we make from our studio work firstly pays our wages and expenses, and anything left over helps fund members of the collective to work on these vital projects that do not come with a source of financial support.

Some of these projects are completed by members of the collective on an entirely voluntary basis, but many of them call for an amount of time and skill that requires reimbursement. We also need to fund things like software and server costs for these projects. 

The small profits we make as a studio aren't enough to enable us to fully realise this important work, and so we welcome donations from those who are interested in supporting us and our upcoming projects of this nature.

## Upcoming projects we want to fund

Faceloader: A simple interface to enable people to download events data from Facebook and use it in other places
I'm OK: A text-based bot developed to support migrants forced to 'sign on' by the UK government
Activist safety zine: A zine exploring the current state of activism in the UK and how to make it easier and safer for people to get involved
Arms Investigation: Investigative research into the extent of the arms trade in Greater Manchester, hopefully leading to an exhibition and/or zine (in collaboration with Manchester School of Architecture students)
