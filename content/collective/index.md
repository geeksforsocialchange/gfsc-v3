The GFSC collective is a diverse range of practitioners from many fields, with a shared interest in working towards positive and collaborative social change. Unlike GFSC Studio, GFSC Collective members work on self-chosen projects on a mostly voluntary basis.

Our focus is on helping each other to create socially impactful and useful tools for a better society. We work collaboratively and voluntarily because we know we can achieve more collectively than we can individually, and we recognise that there is no funding source to support many worthy projects.

Our practice is political. We are experienced activists involved in community, LGBTQ+ and anti-racism organising.

We can help focus campaigns, establish tech infrastructure for community groups, explore solutions to challenging issues affecting groups most in need of support, and more.

Members of the collective offer their time voluntarily, though we strive to pay anyone who ends up contributing a substantial amount of time and skills to any one project. We fund this work in two ways:

1. A percentage of any profits from commercial work
2. Donations from supporters. You can find out more [here](/support)
