If you want to find more ways of using your skills to work on projects that make a meaningful difference, you might be interested in joining the GFSC collective. The first step in becoming a member is to join our Discord channel. We have a lively community and are working on a number of projects at any given time. Introduce yourself, get to know us, and if youâ€™re interested in becoming a formal member of the collective, let us know and we can share more information about our principles and the ways we work. _[EC: This section is WIP, subject to confirming more formal joining procedure!]_
