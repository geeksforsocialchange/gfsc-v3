Rosie is a mostly front end developer with a background in illustration. She finds writing code immensely enjoyable, seeing it as more of a craft practice than a technical job, and likes to help demystify its processes wherever she can. She likes collaborative code, type safety, elegant loops and descriptive names.

Offline she is passionate about knitting, cooking, potato based snacks and things with eyes on them that should not have eyes on them.
