Katja is a developer specialising in the design and implementation of digital services that aim to improve the reach of small charities and community organisations. She works iteratively with clients and users to get as close as possible to what people need. She is an advocate of Elm because it empowers her mission to make code reading accessible & code writing empathetic. She values a culture of collaboration, community, open source, transparency, integrity, generally sharing stuff and giving everyone a voice and a chance of meaningful participation. In her spare time, she runs Code Reading Club & makes hit and miss fermented veg. In a past life she produced independent films and is a believer that sharing stories makes the world a better place.
