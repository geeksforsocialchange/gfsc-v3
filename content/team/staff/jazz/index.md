His care and attention to detail helps him understand the needs of clients in order to to find the solution that is right for them, together. They were a writer before they were a coder, so working towards good, clear communication is of special interest to them. They are also on hand for copywriting, funding bids, lowkey design and, as a former train station announcer, voiceovers.
