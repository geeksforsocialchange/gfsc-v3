Jazz is a web developer who specialises in making neurodivergent-friendly systems to help people collaborate and communicate better together. His care and attention to detail helps him understand the needs of clients in order to to find the solution that is right for them, together. He was a writer before he was a coder, so working towards good, clear communication is of special interest to him. He is also on hand for copywriting, funding bids, lowkey design and, as a former train station announcer, voiceovers.
