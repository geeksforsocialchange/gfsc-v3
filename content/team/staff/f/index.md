F is an anarchist, agender, trans, queer, ace, autistic, mentally ill, disabled, vegan, tattooed, magnetic technologist with buckets of experience working on all kinds of things from video games you’ve never heard of to government websites you use every week.

F is a big advocate for building the smallest possible thing now (not next week), releasing it to the world, and then making it better (if necessary). Ey’s less interested in the technology than what you’re trying to do with it and has a wide range of experience under eir belt and will gladly learn new things (and attempt to unlearn old things to moderate success). Find em on the wider internet as @erbridge.
