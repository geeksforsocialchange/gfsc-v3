honor is an artist and writer based in Norwich, who researches and makes work exploring communication, power, language, community, alienation, and the internet. Through their art practice, they create work across mediums; exploring photography, performance, music, visual art, sculpture, poetry, community building, collaborating, improvising, and more. This varied practice creates a solid foundation for their work with GFSC, supporting them in the tricky business of wrangling words into an order that makes sense.
