Ivan rather enjoys writing code. Currently he uses Ruby on Rails for his day-job but has had a bash at a fair number of other oddities including perl, labview, common lisp and unity. He's also had stabs at javascript and python.

He rather enjoys working on socially minded projects like the ones at GFSC as he believes that there is scope to come up with technological solutions to societal problems.

Outside of programming he rather likes taking walks in his local park (and petting all the dogs), doing "art", listening to music and learning about things on the internet.
