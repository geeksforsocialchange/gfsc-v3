Rebecca is a nice, tired woman from Ashford. She has a background in performance art and weird poetry that no-one reads. She is also a woman of **BUSINESS**.  She works with GFSC writing bids, tenders and pitches for all our ongoing projects. She likes getting really obsessive about small, everyday things, spinning around in a circle and having a bit of a laugh. She is aware this bio sounds deranged but what can you do.
