Alexandria is a trans, neurodivergant, queer, disabled coder/cyberwitch from South Wales. She started out programming via the Ludum Dare Game Jam, a twice annual online event focussed on making games from scratch in a weekend, and has since spent over a decade touching computers professionally, mostly working on systems programming. She has wide-ranging informal mentoring experience, and is passionate about passing on skills and knowledge, particularly to those from backgrounds and communities similar to her own. She is also a member of Trans Tech Tent, a South Wales collective of trans people who are interested in tech. In her spare time she loves learning about new things, and finds her imagination easily captured by a vast range of topics, including philosophy, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, and more.
