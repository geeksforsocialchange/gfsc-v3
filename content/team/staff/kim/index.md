They are an experienced web developer who has built dozens of websites and apps for a large range of community organisations over the last 20 years. They have a PhD in sociology, specialising in grounded theory qualitative research.

This extensive skillset and experience is what has enabled them to develop a multi-methods approach to software development, community activism, and engaged research. This led them to found their studio Geeks for Social Change in 2016, for whom PlaceCal is their flagship project.
