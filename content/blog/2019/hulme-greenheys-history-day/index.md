Join us in a day of celebration of Hulme & Greenheys’ diverse history. We are a group of grassroots historians, residents and academics who have come together to explore the history of our area. We’ve organised this day to help us understand how the four waves of rapid redevelopment over the last 100 years have affected us all, for better and worse.

There will be lots of hands-on activities, an archeological surveying walk, talks on a wide variety of local history topics, and a free lunch open to all. We want everyone to share their stories, learn how research their histories, and have plenty of time for discussion and sharing. Please bring along anything relating to the history of the area you think deserves a wider audience such as photos, artifacts, memories, or the address you used to live.

We will also be recording oral histories throughout the day and invite anyone who wishes to to tell their story to have it documented by a trained historian. Our goal is to collectively submit a funding bid in 2020 to both continue to develop the connections made through this event, and create a community-led archive of all the history projects in our neighbourhood.
