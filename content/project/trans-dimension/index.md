summary: "How we collaborated with Gendered Intelligence to develop a trans-focussed offshoot of our award-winning PlaceCal Community Calendar."

---

As a trans-led studio, we recognise that our community best thrives when it is connected, and at the moment, there are very few trans-specific events listing/sharing spaces. We are working with Gendered Intelligence to take our existing PlaceCal software and create a version which specifically focusses on trans-centric events listings. This will initially be rolled out in London, but with a view to later launching in other cities across the UK.

We are working to develop fresh branding and a website for The Trans Dimension, and will collaborate with Gendered Intelligence to publicise its launch.
