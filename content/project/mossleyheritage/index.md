summary: "How we consulted with Mossley Heritage about their on and offline needs, and helped them develop both a brand world and full website solution."

Mossley Heritage approached us to request a website. However after our initial consultation meetings it became apparent that their branding and design also needed development, so we first created a logo and identity for the project, in collaboration with their existing illustrator who was working on some 'real world' signage. 

We then took this branding and developed them a custom brochure website to promote the project.
