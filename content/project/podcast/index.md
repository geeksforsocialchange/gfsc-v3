Our podcast aims to explore the many themes and topics that are of interest to us as a studio, via a series of conversations with our friends, collaborators and co-conspirators. We focus on navigating technology, ethics, and activism in our day to day lives and work.

We also include some special episodes — members of the studio occasionally deliver talks or panels at external events, and where possible, we aim to record these for our podcast so that they can be enjoyed by a much wider audience. 

In a 2022 survey we discovered that over 60% of our extended community regularly listen to podcasts. Many members of the studio also find podcasts a vital and enriching medium for knowledge sharing and entertainment. 

Our podcast does not currently operate to a fixed schedule, as this enables us to ensure the highest possible quality and relevance for each episode (basically, we make them when we feel like it!) — be sure to subscribe via your podcasting service of choice, to make sure you never miss an episode. We also publish transcripts to our blog – you can find those below!
