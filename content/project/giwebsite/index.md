summary: "How we helped Gendered Intelligence migrate their complex, outdated website onto a new CRM that will better enable them to support their users and administrate their workload."
---

Trans charity Gendered Intelligence approached us with a number of tech-related issues that were affecting their day-to-day operations. We helped them take an overarching view of the best way forward across all their issues, including the development of 'Enquiry Witch', researching their needs and building them a new CRM based on Jekyll, and ultimately migrating their old website over onto this new CRM.

Their old website had been built using a number of different interlocking systems layered up over a number of years, to a point where no one left in the organisation fully understood the interdependences or how everything slotted together. This meant that day to day, staff were unable to easily make changes to the website. We helped unpick this web of systems, and rebuild their site to a new design in a way which will be sustainable and easy to maintain for the long term.
