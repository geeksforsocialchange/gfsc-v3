Leading trans charity Gendered Intelligence approached us with a number of tech-related issues that were affecting their day-to-day operations. We helped them take an overarching view of the best way forward across all their issues, including the development of our [Enquiry Witch](https://gfsc.studio/project/enquiry-witch/) enquiry manager, researching their needs and building them a new CMS in Ruby on Rails, developing a new visual identity and information structure, and ultimately migrating their old website over onto this new CRM.

Gendered Intelligence directly supports trans people with a particular focus on trans youth, and develops and delivers training to shift how society at large understands and supports trans people in work, school and beyond. This means their website needs to reflect accurately their offer, and provide clear and concise pathways to accessing resources and support. 

Their old website had been built using a number of different interlocking systems layered up over a number of years, to a point where no one in the organisation fully understood the interdependences or how everything slotted together. This meant that day to day, staff were unable to easily make changes to the website. We helped unpick this web of systems, and build them a new website with a new brand identity which will be sustainable and easy to maintain for the long term.

Because of the way in which the old website evolved, the information on the site was often outdated, self-contradictory and difficult to navigate for users. We undertook a full content audit and ran user testing to restructure their website around the needs of the people who use it, rather than reflecting simply rebuilding the same messy structures that had stemmed from over a decade of internal re-structuring. 

First impressions are massively important, so we worked with long-time design partner [Studio Squid](https://studiosquid.co.uk/) to rebrand Gendered Intelligence and design their new website as well as supporting them to implement the new brand identity in key internal and external documents, presentations, business cards and more. The new branding, in combination with their restructured website and refreshed key messaging, helps Gendered Intelligence to appear trustworthy and knowledgable, as well as friendly and approachable. 

Through our longstanding working relationship with Gendered Intelligence we built an understanding of the issues and qualities they most want to project with their website and branding, and used this understanding to collaboratively design and develop their new site. Working from a thorough understanding of their key values means that the site we delivered can best support Gendered Intelligence in carrying out their day-to-day work. Itâ€™s now much clearer who they provide support for, and how to access it. The new site is also much easier for Gendered Intelligence staff to update, which means they can keep key information up to date and focus on their on-the-ground service provision.
