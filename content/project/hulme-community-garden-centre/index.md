Hulme Community Garden Centre approached us looking for a website, but they didn't have the budget to have us develop  for them. Instead, we hosted some workshops to help them strategise, deciding what needs to go on it, who reads it and what they're looking for. 

Though this research and consultancy we created a clearly defined brief that a staff member was able to implement themselves in WordPress without our help. With their permission we share the final Trello user story board that the site was created with.

This process saved money and time while making sure that key information was right where people wanted it, including loads of information that wasn't previously on the site but was crucial to planning a visit. HCGC don't keep visitor numbers but staff anecdotally observed a large uptick to visits following the site relaunch.
