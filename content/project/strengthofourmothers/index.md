Strength of our mothers was a partnership project led by the National Black Arts Alliance, supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. It consisted of a book, a series of live performances, and a website.

The project documents the lives of 23 white women in interracial relationships with African and Afro-Caribbean men from the 1940s to 2000. Each woman's story is told in her own voice, or by her children.

We developed a visual style for the website, and then built it accordingly, in a way which forefronts the stories of the women, but also offers space for promotion (and later documentation) of the live events and the book.
