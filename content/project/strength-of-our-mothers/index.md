Strength of our Mothers was a project led by the National Black Arts Alliance, supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund. 

The project documents the lives of 23 white women in interracial relationships with African and African-Caribbean men from the 1940s to 2000. Each woman's story is told in her own voice, or by her children.

Project outputs consisted of a book, a series of live performances, and a website. We produced the website and brand as a single page standalone site using a static site generator, so it never needs to be updated and is free to host. We did this as a pragmatic reaction to Heritage Lottery funding only covering web hosting for 3 years, meaning many heritage projects simply vanish after the 3 year period is over.

You can download the book and watch the launch on the website!
