The folks behind LGBT History Month approached us as they wanted to facilitate some celebrations in Manchester during LGBT History month. On their behalf, we took care of all event planning (venue/staff liaison, catering, bar etc), and designed the event itself, after researching what would be most appropriate for the celebrations. We also constructed a promotional website, including all copywriting and design, and oversaw the smooth running of the event itself.
