summary: "How we helped Resistance Lab publish their first report in both analogue and digital versions"

Resistance Lab's first report was titled 'A growing threat to life: Taser usage by Greater Manchester Police'. We used Observable to help them develop the charts and infographics in the report. Once the report was complete, we helped them design and publish it on their website, and also designed and printed a 'zine' style publication for distribution to radical bookshops and zine distros in Manchester and across the UK.
