During the COVID-19 pandemic, we became aware that, like in many communities across the UK, there were people in our neighbourhood who were struggling with numerous needs, including access to groceries, gas and electric payments, prescription collection, cooking hot meals, and more. Taphouse TV dinners aimed to offer support across all of these needs through a network of volunteers, and especially to focus on delivering one hot meal a week to those who need it most.

We helped them with a database and service design which enabled the project to run, and to be easily used by both volunteers and those seeking support.
