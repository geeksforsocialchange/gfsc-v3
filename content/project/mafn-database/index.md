Manchester Age Friendly Neighbourhoods was a practice-led research programme that aimed to address the barriers that people face in their daily lives and providing more ways for people to contribute to their communities.

We ran a consultation process with PHASE at MMU to establish what was required for the specific context of this project, and then we developed a database which met their needs.
