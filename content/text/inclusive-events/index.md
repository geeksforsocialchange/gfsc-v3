title: The Trans Dimension - Guide to Inclusive Events
---

### This zine is an act of care. It is the result of deliberate and enduring collaboration rooted in the idea that there is no single answer to the question ‘how can we improve access to our spaces?’

It was produced by and for trans/non-binary and disabled people. 

The project was led by __Geeks for Social Change__ in collaboration with __Sarah Joynt-Bowe__ from Prosocial Strat and was deeply informed by the generous and thoughtful contributions of volunteers and supporters of __Gendered Intelligence__ and members of __Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People__. 

When we asked our collaborators for affirming or positive experiences they’ve had at events we heard _“The best I’ve had is mediocre.”_ We want to believe that this is not because of a lack of understanding and responsibility, but for a lack of guidance and resources. Hopefully this zine will help.

## What this zine is for

We originally thought we
would be able to boil down
accessibility to a few yes/no
key questions about things like
toilets and hearing loops.

The more we talked to fellow
trans and disabled people, the
more we found that this wasn’t
really a thing that could be
simplified. And most of the
time, these things were out of
the reach of event organizers,
(who are often trans and
disabled themselves), to do
anything about.

For example: gender neutral
toilets are no help if they’re
not also accessible, the door
staff are transphobic, or the
event doesn’t have long enough
breaks for wheelchair users to
actually use them.

All we can really do is try to
make things better. We want
this to be a care oriented
process — that means people
shouldn’t feel bad for not being
able to accommodate everyone,
because universal accessibility
is a myth anyway.

This zine therefore aims to
help you do two things:

1. Have a conversation with your group about what accessibility looks like for you – some talking points for your next meeting.
2. Create an accessibility statement to share with the world – this is the starting point from which we can try and create a more inclusive world, together. 

### What people have said
#### Describe an affirming or positive experience you had at an event.

> The best I've had is mediocre. As an NB trans woman that is basically the best I can hope for – not being thrown out because I happen to have a penis and being allowed to be the only f****r there.

> People just accepting what I say my identity is. That's all. 

> When organisers volunteer as much information as they can so that people are able to make good choices. 

> Gender neutral toilets! Everyone tells you their pronouns. 

#### If you feel comfortable, describe a bad expeirence you've had at an event. 

> Anywhere I go where my name is questioned is enough to tell me whether it's inclusive. 

> Stood at a bar with a friend, and a person comes up to ask if I'm tv or cd [transvestite or cross dresser], then he asks if I'm pre or post op. I'm literally just having a drink with a friend.

#### What else do we need to know about making events trans inclusive? 

> Accessibility isn't just about the physical environment. Sometimes it's about the attitude of the people inside. 

> There has to be safe access to toilets for trans people and the guests at said event have to be able to be respectful to each other, including calling people the correct name/pronouns they actually want to be called.

> It's cool when we have event ground rules that include accepting what people say their gender is. And that they remember some of us are disabled. 

> Make bold choices with integrity that protect folks. Don't let folks get hurt just because doing so is _nice_ to the people immediately around you. 

## Part 1: Accessibility Guide 
### _"I can join in"_
#### Access is personal. There are no hard and fast rules. It's important to remember that what makes an event accessible to one person may make it impossible for another. 

All we can do is approach this with transparency and care
for our communities.
This document is a
working and evolving
guide to what makes
events accessible for
our community. We
welcome any additions
or feedback via
[info@transdimension.uk](mailto:info@transdimension.uk)

### What is accessibility?

Accessibility is about sharing
the labour. People in our
communities are already
making extra effort to access
spaces every day. Our job is to
lower barriers to participation
for our groups and events.

We want our community to be
able to participate fully. And
for everyone who wishes to
participate to bring themselves
authentically and safely.

### What should I be thinking about?

- Don’t assume you know
what access or inclusivity
looks like. Remember there’s
no such thing as ‘fully
accessible’.
- Make it clear who the
space/event is for and how
you will prioritise them —
transparency is the key to
getting it right more often.
- Check back in with your
community, often, and see if
what you’re doing is working.

> Don't just say a venue is accessible – instead, say if it has or does not have different things, and then I can determine if it is accessible for me!

> [when thinking about toilets] Most importantly a disabled access toilet is one that is in use and not filled with storage, and hasn't got its assistance pull-cord tied up out of reach

### Before the event

- Produce __plain English/
easy read__ versions of event
information
- __Clearly outline__ your access
accommodations (don’t hide
limitations)
- Clarify your __gender inclusion__
policy
- Give __multiple ways for
people to communicate__
their needs (including email,
form, text, and a person at
the event)
- If possible, offer __funding__
(both for the attendee and
their PA)
- Consider varying the __timing__
of your events (some in the
day, some in the evening)
- Make __transport__ options
clear (getting to and from)
- Offer __wayfinding__ support in
advance (consider a video
tour)
- Make it very clear if there
will be __alcohol__ at the event
- Encourage your venue to
invest in __staff accessibility
training__ to avoid common
miscommunications and
oppressive treatment
- Discuss what you would
do in a __medical emergency__.
Some things to consider:
is anyone first aid trained?
Do you have a first aid kit,
epi-pen, narcan, or other
emergency meds on hand?
- Consider what __mental
health__ scenarios might arise
at your event, and what your
response would be. Be aware
of how some structurally
disadvantaged groups’ MH
crises can be mishandled by
police and NHS
- Not all transphobia is the
same! __Consider the ways you
might be excluding__ trans
men/transmasculine people,
trans women/transfeminine
people, and non binary people.
- Make it clear what __COVID
precautions__ will be taken
at the event, if any. Be
aware a lack of COVID
precautions will make your
event inaccessible to many
disabled people.
- Ask the venue if they
have __detailed wheelchair
accessibility guidance__ — for
e.g. can they accommodate
any chair, or only smaller
manual ones?

### At the event

- Think about the __welcome__
your guests experience —
how can you make the event
structure and its access
accommodations clear?
- Know and understand
the __physical access__
accommodations and
limitations of the space
(both getting around and
participating)
- Offer __remote participation__
where possible
- Make sure there are
__captions__ on all videos and
live streamed elements of
your event
- Be mindful of __stimulation__
(sound, temperature, large
groups) and offer quiet
spaces
- Make sure that you offer a
variety of __seating__ options
including strong chairs
without armrests
- Have clear __wayfinding__
(signage with a strong
colour contrast) and
consider sending a video
tour ahead of time
- Be ready to change __lighting__,
if possible
- Test and understand the
__acoustics__ of the space —
can you offer a quiet space?
- Offer __printed copies__ of all
presentations and materials
- Encourage __name tags__
(including an option to share
if you can’t read them)
- Offer comfort __breaks__ and
make sure they’re long
enough for someone to
access the toilet and/or
refreshments
- Clearly signpost the __toilets__
(we highly recommend
gender neutral changing
places toilets as standard)
- Know and communicate the
space’s __emergency protocols__

### Some thoughts on accessibility for those who are D/deaf and hard of hearing

Inclusion and accessibility for
the D/deaf community can
be one of the most daunting
aspects of event accessibility
for organisers.

This is because, unlike some
other aspects of accessibility
planning (e.g. venue access),
making an event accessible
for D/deaf and hard of hearing
people is entirely within the
hands of the event organiser.

If you can manage it, BSL
interpretation is the goldstandard of event accessibility
for many in the D/deaf
community. If it is possible for
you to provide this within your
budget, you should absolutely
strive for it.

However, offering (and paying
for) BSL interpretation can
be one of the biggest ticket
expenses that any event
organiser will face (remember
that for events longer than
60 minutes you will need at
least two interpreters). Often
these costs can add up to
more than everything else in
the event combined, so it is
understandable that this may
feel out of reach for many
promoters.

There are some alternatives
which still provide a good level
of support, but may be more
within the reach of smaller
event hosts.

If your event is online, many of
the biggest online streaming
providers offer AI-captioning.
It may not be perfect, but it’s
better than nothing!

For live events, or online
events with a bigger budget,
human-typed live captions
are still cheaper than BSL
interpretation, but more
reliable than AI captioning.

Captioning of any kind has the
added bonus of supporting
those who may be lightly hard
of hearing, or struggle to focus
on voices in crowded spaces,
but don’t necessarily know
BSL.

Ultimately, you should consult
directly with the D/deaf
community who are likely to
be coming to your event, in
order to ensure that you re
supporting them to the best of
your abilities.

### After the event
- Welcome active feedback
from attendees via multiple
channels
- Give opportunities to make
connections via contact
lists or groups to join
- Have a key follow up contact
for outstanding questions or
comments

## Part 2: Venue and group audit
### The following are the specific questions we ask all venues or groups who wish to be listed on The Trans Dimension site. 
#### Given our non-carceral approach to inclusion (which is often out of promoters hands), we will only flag things if an answer has not been provided — the goal is to get people to engage in the process.
We share these questions here as
provocations and thinking/talking points
for venues and groups who are seeking to
improve their accessibility.

Fill them out, and use them as the
starting point for your accessibility
statement.

### Getting around 
Q1. __Please describe the venue's toilets__ and clarify if your venue has (yes/no): 
- Gender neutral toilets
- Wheelchair accessible toilets
- Changing Places toilets (see [changing-places.org](https://changing-places.org) for more detail)

Q2. __Please describe the venue's general physical accessibility.__ Consider getting into the space, moving around, and getting to toilets or other essential areas. 

Q3. __What's the best way to get to the venue?__ Please be specific about public transportation options and the route from the nearest stop to the venue. 

Q4. __Does your venue offer other spaces to decompress__ if guests or participants are overwhelmed (quiet spaces)? (yes/no)

### Proactive inclusion 
Q5. __Do you have a named, dedicated point of contact__ for access needs at the event? (yes/no)

Q6. __Do you have a named, dedicated point of contact__ that people can email after the event to send feedback? (yes/no)

Q7. __What training have your staff or volunteers had?__ Please confirm if they will be briefed on the accessibility features and limitations of the space and your event. 

Q8. __Does the event or organisation have a code of conduct or 'safe spaces' policy?__ (yes/no)

Q9. __What situations, if any, would you involve the police at the event?__

Q10. __How does your work/group support trans people?__
