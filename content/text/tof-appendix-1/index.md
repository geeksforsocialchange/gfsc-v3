## What are the barriers that stop you from achieving what you want to achieve?

Volunteer capacity and struggling to find core organisers 

*“We are all overloaded and tired!”*

This came up again and again 

Financial barriers 

Funding events while keeping financial barrier to entry low – recognising that trans people often have less access to funds so knowing the importance of keeping resources, events, low-cost. 

Not being able to pay staff or collaborators 

Lack of time due to needing to spend more time working 

Structural disempowerment as trans people and small organisations 

Harassment from the government 

The police as an obstacle

Higher education being profit based and expensive

Discrimination *“i.e. transphobia, transmisogyny, transmysogynoir, lack of awareness and support for disabled trans people, discrimination based on protected characteristics in general”*

Having to rely on personal connections 

Not being able to find suitable, accessible venues 

Not knowing where to promote events to other trans people 

Disability and higher support needs impacting all plans 

### What is your vision for the world you want to live in?

Safety and peace

Ending violence against minorities and discrimination in any form 

Financial security and eradication of systemic transphobia 

Having needs met *“such as housing, healthcare, transportation etc”*

Access to gender affirming care 

NHS reform to eliminate waiting lists 

Community care and mutual aid led

*“people supporting others in their communities in whatever way they can, and creating spaces where people can ask for help eg getting to appointments, getting an energy medication etc”*

Enjoying hobbies without harassment 

Accessible and intersectional spaces 

Energy to thrive not just survive 

Being seen as whole individuals rather than reduced to one-dimensional caricatures

*“A world in which we can just be”*

More trans only spaces 

Celebration of trans-ness

## Other reflections

### Trans Mutual Aid Manchester

Intersectionality should be at the forefront to avoid leaving anyone behind 

Visions go beyond the capabilities of TOF 

Community led care is feasible 

Either through empowering existing communities or creating new ones

Lack of established base of trans-first communities that can provide community care on a consistent basis 

Funding is a big issue 

Creating sustainable revenue streams 

### Our own reflections as people administering the fund

Groups don’t feel like they can take a grand, need a lot of coaching and encouragement

A sense things get scarier when you accept money 

Fear of cancellation 

Personal lives are stressful and intersect with all of the issues raised here – lack of capacity, self-funded projects, struggling to find core organisers

Structural issues with funders
