description: "Projects focussed on the communities of Hulme and Manchester, where GFSC first began."

GFSC is a distributed studio and collective, with members across the UK and around the world. However, the studio began in the heart of Hulme, a neighbourhood in Manchester (UK), and our founder Kim is still based there — so we frequently work on projects which centre this community, and that of the wider city of Manchester. Hulme is a diverse neighbourhood with many unique challenges, including the interactions between its residents of differing races and incomes, (including a substantial lower-income population), and the large number of students who live in the University of Manchester halls of residence situated within the ward. We strive to listen closely to the needs of this community, and through developing projects which support and uplift them, we can learn wider lessons which can apply to other communities we come into contact with.
