Many of us at GFSC have lived experience of disability, and of navigating a world not made for us. We work by listening and learning first-hand from disabled individuals and groups about their needs and challenges, and — using research and tech solutions — figuring out ways of smoothing the road ahead of all of us. We believe that the best way to make progress is by listening and asking questions, and working to truly understand the challenges, oppressions and holes in provision we're up against. We aim to be guided by the needs of people, not the capabilities of tech, and we strive to build solutions that are totally custom, but also potentially transferrable to other settings, once developed.
