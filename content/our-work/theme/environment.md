We face a rapidly oncoming global climate crisis which can no longer be ignored. We strive to be mindful of the environmental impact of all our work, and we are especially excited to work on projects which have positive environmental change at their heart. The tech community can sometimes be complacent about its impact on the environment, and can hide behind false or overblown claims about positive environmental impacts of tech solutions. At GFSC we strive to understand the impacts of our work, but also to recognise that we are not climate specialists. We aim to work with those who have real knowledge of the positive and negative impacts of tech on the climate, and to follow best practices with their guidance.
