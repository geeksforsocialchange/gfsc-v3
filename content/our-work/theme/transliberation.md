As a trans-led studio, we are deeply invested in working on projects which help realise equality, liberation, and life-long flourishing for the trans community. We aim to use tech and research to elevate the voices and needs of trans folk, and to provide bespoke solutions to the challenges and issues we face together. We are always keen to work with other trans individuals and organisations to help achieve our collective goals. In a world which can so often be hostile to us, we strive to contribute to a different narrative, and we look for any opportunity where our work can be an activist force to uplift all trans people.
