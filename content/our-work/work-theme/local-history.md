We have worked on a number of projects which seek to highlight, display, and where possible, expand the histories of different groups of people or locations. Learning about the past experiences of our area or community can teach us about where we've come from, and about where we could go in future â€” as well as simply being fascinating collections of stories and facts about areas we care about. But so often, the histories of smaller organisations and communities end up being stored away in literal or metaphorical attics, where they are challenging to access, poorly maintained, and in danger of being lost for good. We work with organisations and individuals to help unearth, research, tidy, and present worthy histories in a compelling and engaging way, which both uplifts their existing community, and welcomes new people in.
