GFSC are distributed widely across the UK, but we all share in common a passion for working in a situated way: in considering specific communities and the geographic areas in which they reside. This is why a number of our projects have been built with a specific location, setting, and community in mind (even if this work might later be transferable to other locations). By working in this way we create solutions which take into account the unique, varied and often project-transforming needs of different areas from the very start, rather than attempting to shoehorn generic fixes onto communities who need, and deserve, a more focussed, individual approach. We strive to create solutions which enable local communities to thrive, grow, and tackle challenges of inequality and lack of access in all forms.
