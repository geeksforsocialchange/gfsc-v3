summary: "Projects which constructively engage with the challenges faced by communities at the forefront of the fight against racism"
---
Our politics are pro-immigrant, anti-police, anti-state violence, and crucially, anti-racism in all its forms. We seek out all opportunities to constructively engage with the challenges faced by communities at the forefront of these fights, seeking to be led by voices with lived experience of these forms of prejudice. At GFSC we are deeply rooted in the anti-state violence and police abolition movements, which are coming to the forefront of more and more people's minds after countless stories of atrocities across the US, UK and globally. We are also keen to engage in other areas of work which uplift the voices of those who has historically been oppressed, and fight racism wherever and however it shows itself, in tech and beyond.
