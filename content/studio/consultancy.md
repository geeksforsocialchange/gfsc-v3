Recent years have seen technology made harder and harder to understand, by deliberate design of people who want to make money from your lack of understanding. Technology can simultaneously seem like a "magic wand" to fix all your problems, but also an insurmountable and impossible to understand mess.

It's therefore really common that you have a really good understanding of what your current situation is, an idea that what you want to do, and a rough idea how to do it, but then have no idea where to go from there. This is where we come in!

We can consult on your projects to help demystify and untangle technology you're currently using, see how you can use it better, and perhaps commission something new (in other words: reduce, reuse, recycle first).

We can coach you to solve your problems yourself by teaching you enough to get going and understand what's really going on.

We can work to support you to do funding applications for collaborative work.
