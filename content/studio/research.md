Like technology, research can seem a scary, daunting and expensive prospect.

It doesn't have to be. A good research base is the stable foundation on which you can make informed and careful choices. This both gives the confidence that you're doing the right thing, and saves tons of time and money by helping you avoid making expensive mistakes.

We like to start any new project with a research phase that consolidates what you've already done, and interviews staff, stakeholders and volunteers at a range of levels to come to a shared understanding of problems.

Our collective draws on a wide range of expertise in multiple subject areas, such as technology, sociology, architecture, history, state violence, trans liberation, critical race theory, etc.

We can conduct fieldwork, carry out interviews, analyse data, and suggest the best solutions for your organisation. Our goal is to provide you with the toolkit you need to make informed decisions about the best way forwards â€” whether that's with us or with another organisation more suited to your needs.
